# STM32CUBE-HAL Bare Metal Applications    
Various Example Applications on different Peripherals of STM32F446RE-NUCLEO Board  
-> Uses STM32CUBE HAL Layer.  
-> Use it as a reference for your application, or start developing on top of it.  
-> Each Dir contains different project foucused on different applications.  
-> I will really appreciate any kind of help here, please correct my mistakes if needed.

Currently this repo contains example applications for:-  
-> Basic Clock Configuration (Clock_Config_Example)  
-> PLL Configuration (PLL_Config_Example)  
-> Polling Based UART Application (CubeHAL_USART_Example)  
-> Interrupt Based UART Application (CubeHAL_USART_IT_Example)  
-> Polling BasedTime Base generation using Basic Timer (Timer_Delay_Example)  
-> Interrupt Based Time Base generation using Basic Timer (Timer_Delay_IT_Example)  
-> Input Capture using General Purpose Timer and Calculation of frequency of the applied signalof freq 32.768KHz  (LSE clock)(Timer_IC_Example)  
-> Input Capture using General Purpose Timer and Calculation of frequency of the applied signalof freq 50KHz, generated using Basic timer. (Timer_IC_Example)  
-> Output Capture Using General Purpose Timer and generation of signals with various frequencies. (Timer_OC_Example)  
-> PWM Using General Purpose Timer and generation of PWM signals with different Duty cycles. (Timer_PWM_Example)  
-> More Coming Soon..
